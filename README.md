## Requirements
For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.
You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).
If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.
    $ node --version
    v8.11.3
    $ npm --version
    6.1.0
If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.
    $ npm install npm -g
